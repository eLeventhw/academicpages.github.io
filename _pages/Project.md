Weihai Tianxin Modern Service Technology Research Institute Co., Ltd.                   
======
*Laboratory Researcher*
* Participated in the development of personalized tutoring software for long-distance running in the Physical Education Exam for High School Entrance
*	Obtained real-time multi-angle motion video streams using DJI drones and applied MODNet and AlphaPose models to acquire 2D skeleton coordinates.
*	Conducted motion analysis through the 3D reconstruction of human skeletons, proposing a “matrix tracking” strategy based on skeleton similarity to achieve skeleton matching.

Development of Mathematical Modelling Assistance Software 
======
*Independent Researcher*
*	Independently developed mathematical modelling assistance software inspired by SPSSPRO.
* Implemented a function to provide adaptive data analysis results based on inserted algorithms and the data uploaded by users, meeting basic algorithmic needs for mathematical modelling competitions and reducing participants' programming burden.
